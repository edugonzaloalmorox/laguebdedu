      <description>I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Newcastle University. I am mainly interested in questions about applied economics with a particular focus on health and computational social science.
I am currently investigating empirical issues in the market for adult long term (social) care in England. I am also involved in projects associated with unhealthy behaviours and tools for open science.
Before my PhD, I was a NIHR reserch methods fellow in the Health Economics Group at Newcastle University and prior to that I held several positions as an economics consultant at Funcas and the European Corporate Affairs Office at Banco Santander.</description>
