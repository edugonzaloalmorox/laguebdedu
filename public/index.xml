      <description>La semana pasada arrancaba el año en el Congreso de los diputados. El 2018 dejó varios momentos que sin duda serán carne de hemeroteca. Entre los episodios con más seguimiento mediático destacaron la aprobación de la primera moción de censura contra un gobierno en democracia o la expulsión la expulsión forzosa de un diputado del hemiciclo por su comportamiento (el segundo de la democracia).
Pero, qué otras cosas caracterizaron la actividad parlamentaria durante 2018?</description>

      <description>A key element for a health system is the quality of their services. Knowing how good (or bad) health centres are doing may be useful for policy makers to assess their performance and propose improvements. For other services such as residential and nursing care homes, quality is an important aspect to motivate the choice of certain premises over others.
In this post I look at the quality of care homes.</description>

      <description>England as other developed countries is ageing. Is this process going to increase, stabilise, decrease …?

      <description>After several attempts I am finally deploying a website. This has been a long journey of trial and error where I have two main sources: This post by Allison Presmanes and this video by John Muschelli.

      <description>I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Newcastle University. My research interests lie in applied economics with a particular focus on health and computational social science.
I am currently investigating empirical issues in the market for adult long term (social) care in England. I am also involved in projects associated with unhealthy behaviours and tools for open science.
Before my PhD, I was a NIHR reserch methods fellow in the Health Economics Group at Newcastle University and prior to that I held several positions as an economics consultant at Funcas and the European Corporate Affairs Office at Banco Santander.</description>
