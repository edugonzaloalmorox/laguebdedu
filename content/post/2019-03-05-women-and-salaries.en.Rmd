The 8th of March is the [International Women's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women%27s_Day). In this week's [#tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) I use data data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau to  plot the gender gap in earnings of women workers in the US from 1979 to 2011. I use `gganimate()` to illustrate this difference in salaries between men and women over time and by age ranges. The gap (i.e. less female salary percent of male salary) increases at older ages. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, include=TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 10}

library(gganimate)

library(ggpubr)


earnings_female <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-03-05/earnings_female.csv") 



rank_data <- earnings_female %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  mutate(ordering = rank(percent)*1.0) %>%
  ungroup() 


rank_data$Year = as.Date(as.character(rank_data$Year), format = "%Y")



p<-ggplot(rank_data,
          aes(ordering, group = group ,color= group,fill= group)) +
  geom_tile(aes(y = percent/2, 
                height = percent,
                width = 0.9), alpha = 0.75) +
