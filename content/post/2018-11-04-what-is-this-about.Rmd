After several attempts I am finally deploying a website. This has been a long journey of trial and error where I have two main sources: [This post](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) by Allison Presmanes and this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syWAKaj-4ck) by John Muschelli. 

The idea of this website is to contribute to the community and show case studies that may be helpful for some. You are likely to find a bunch of things associated with care homes, ageing and long-term care in England. Still, there will be room for other projects that I find interesting. 

The website is built with R [`blogdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). It is hosted and deployed in [netlifly.com](https://www.netlify.com). The template is based on the [Beautiful](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo) theme. 


The code of this website and other projects is on my [Github](https://github.com/edugonzaloalmorox).
