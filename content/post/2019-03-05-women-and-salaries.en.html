<p>The 8th of March is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women%27s_Day">International Women’s Day</a>. In this week’s <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">#tidytuesday</a> I use data data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau to plot the gender gap in earnings of women workers in the US from 1979 to 2011. I use <code>gganimate()</code> to illustrate this difference in salaries between men and women over time and by age ranges. The gap (i.e. less female salary percent of male salary) increases at older ages.</p>
