<p>A good thing from France is the wide network of trains over the whole country. The company in charge of their management is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNCF">SNCF</a> which is state-owned . This week the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">#tidytuesday</a> challenge consisted of plotting information regarding the the trains. The dataset is quite complete and there are several options for the representation. My choice for this plot is to represent the variation over time in the number of lines covered by each station. Interestingly, most stations have reduced the number of destinations.</p>
