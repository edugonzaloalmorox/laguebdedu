<p>This weekâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-06-11">tidytuesday project</a> proposed a dataset provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA">NASA</a> with information on meteorites. I plotted where the biggest meteorites were found during the last 119 years. Interestingly, countries such as Oman, Morocco or Libya have received most impacts.</p>
