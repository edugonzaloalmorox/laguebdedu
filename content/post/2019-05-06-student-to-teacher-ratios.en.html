<p>A measure to define the quality of education is the number of students per teacher. In this <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-05-07">tidytuesday project</a> I use data from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO">UNESCO</a> to visualise the differences among European Countries. As it happens with other domains, such as <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/health-knowledge-gateway/societal-impacts/inequalities">health</a> there are significant differences depending on the type of education considered. The plot is a good example of how to represent different levels of a factor in a faceted <code>ggplot</code>.</p>
