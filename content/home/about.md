# Biography

I am a PhD researcher in Economics at [Newcastle University](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/business-school/). My main research interests are applied economics with a particular focus on health and computational social science.

I am currently investigating empirical issues in the market for social care in England. I am also interested in elements associated with unhealthy behaviours and tools for open science.

Before my PhD, I was a [NIHR reserch methods fellow](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/funding-and-support/funding-for-training-and-career-development/training-programmes/research-methods-programme/research-methods-fellowship-and-internships/) in the [Health Economics Group](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/healtheconomicsgroup/) at Newcastle University and prior to that I held several positions as economist in the industry. For further details please click on my [CV](../pdf/EGA_CV_2018.pdf) or on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-gonzalo-almorox-5b8b4955/) profile. 

In my free time I ride bikes, sometimes [for a while](http://trackleaders.com/transconrace15i.php?name=72___Edu_Gonzalo), or run in [weird places](http://www.saharamarathon.org/en/races/results-2015/)
